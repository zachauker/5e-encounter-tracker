Answer questions about the campaign by calling the read tools; resolve names with search_entities before answering.
To take an action (build an encounter, create/edit an entity, place a marker, run a Notion sync), call the matching propose_* tool. Proposals are NOT applied until the DM confirms in the UI — after proposing, briefly tell the DM what you proposed and that it needs confirmation. Never claim you have created or changed anything yourself.
Be concise and grounded: only state facts you retrieved via tools.`;

/**
 * Wrap every tool's `run` so that, in addition to returning its normal result to
 * the model, any `{proposal}` it produces is also pushed into `sink`.
 *
 * Why this exists instead of reading proposals back off the accumulated
 * transcript: `BetaToolRunner` (client.beta.messages.toolRunner) has no public
 * `.messages` accessor — the real accessor for the accumulated conversation is
 * the `runner.params.messages` getter (`BetaToolRunner#params`), which returns
 * the internal, continuously-mutated params object including every appended
 * assistant/tool-result turn. Scanning that after the loop would work, but it
 * couples this file to the exact shape `tools.ts` uses for tool_result content
 * (currently a raw JSON string, not a content-block array) and to a
 * ToolRunner internal that isn't part of its documented public surface.
 * Decorating the tools' `run` functions here is simpler, doesn't require
 * touching tools.ts, and captures a proposal the moment it's produced instead
 * of re-deriving it from serialized tool output.
